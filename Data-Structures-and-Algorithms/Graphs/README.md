# Graph Representations in Java

This repository demonstrates various ways to represent graphs in Java.

### Types of Graph Representations:
1. **Adjacency List**
2. **Adjacency Matrix**
3. **Edge List**
4. **2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)**

## üîó Adjacency List Representation

In this approach, we create an adjacency list using an array of size 4 (since the graph contains 4 vertices). Each element in the array holds a list of neighboring vertices.

For example:
- Vertex `0` is connected to vertex `2`, so we store `{0, 2}` at index `0`.
- Vertex `2` is connected to vertices `0`, `1` and `3`, so we store `{2, 0}`, `{2, 1}` and `{2, 3}` at index `2`.

We can implement an adjacency list using:
- A list of lists (`List<List<Integer>>`)
- A HashMap
- Or (as used here) an array of `ArrayList<Integer>`

### Example 1: Undirected and Unweighted Graph

> üîç Check the `UndirectedUnWeightedGraph` class for implementation.

### Example 2: Undirected and Weighted Graph

## üßÆ Adjacency Matrix Representation

<img width="453" alt="Adjacency Matrix" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c98f4dd-5207-4b2b-a05f-17275b9c3e48" />

In this representation, we use a 2D matrix to show connections between vertices.

- A `1` at cell `(0, 2)` means there's an edge between vertex `0` and vertex `2`.
- A `0` at cell `(0, 1)` means there's **no edge** between vertex `0` and vertex `1`.
- A `0` at `(1, 1)` indicates there's no self-loop on vertex `1`.
- A `0` at `(3, 0)` means vertex `3` is not connected to vertex `0`.

For **weighted graphs**, instead of using `1` to show a connection, we store the actual weight of the edge. If there‚Äôs no edge, we can use `0` or `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (or `-1`, depending on use case).

## üìä Adjacency List vs. Adjacency Matrix

| Criteria              | Adjacency List                               | Adjacency Matrix            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Space Complexity**  | O(V + E)                                     | O(V¬≤)                       |
| **Efficient For**     | Sparse Graphs                                | Dense Graphs                |
| **Edge Lookup Time**  | O(V) (needs traversal)                       | O(1)                        |
| **Insert/Delete Edge**| O(1)                                | O(1)                        |
| **Insert/Delete Vertex** | O(V)                                         | O(V¬≤)                       |

> Adjacency List is more space-efficient for sparse graphs because it only stores connected neighbors, whereas the adjacency matrix stores all possible connections, including non-existent ones.

## üßæ Edge List Representation

In this representation, we simply list all the edges of the graph. For example, if we have the following connections:

```java
Edges = {{0,2}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}}
```

There are 4 edges, so our edge list size is 4.

We can implement the edge list using:
- `ArrayList`
- `LinkedList`

In this repository, we use an **`ArrayList`** to represent the edge list.

> Edge List is especially useful in algorithms that require sorting edges, such as **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms (e.g., Kruskal's algorithm).

---

## üß± 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)

An **implicit graph** is a logical graph that is represented using a 2D matrix.

This type of graph is **not explicitly stored** as edges or adjacency lists ‚Äî instead, a 2D grid is treated like a graph where each cell is a vertex, and neighboring cells represent edges.

### Example use cases:
- Shortest Path in a Maze
- Flood Fill Algorithm (like in Paint)
- Island Counting Problems

```text
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

In most problems, you're expected to traverse the matrix as a graph.

> We‚Äôve seen several graph representations, but **Adjacency List** is most commonly used due to its space and time efficiency.

# üîÅ Graph Traversals

To process or explore all nodes in a graph, we use **graph traversal algorithms**.

### Types of Graph Traversals:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

Graphs allow us to choose **any vertex** as the starting point for traversal.

## üåê Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**BFS** explores the graph level by level. It visits all **immediate neighbors** before moving on to their neighbors.

### Example:
Starting from vertex `0`, the traversal order will be:

```
Level 0: 0  
Level 1: 1, 2  
Level 2: 3, 4  
Level 3: 5  
Level 4: 6  
```

### How it works:
- Start at a vertex (e.g., `0`)
- Visit and enqueue all unvisited neighbors
- Dequeue the next vertex and repeat

> Think of it like **level-order traversal** in binary trees.

---

### üß™ BFS Algorithm (Single Connected Component)

```java
public static void bfs(ArrayList<Edge>[] graph, int v){
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[v];
    queue.add(0);
    while(!queue.isEmpty()){
        int curr = queue.remove();
        if (!visited[curr]) {
            System.out.print(curr + " ");
            visited[curr] = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < graph[curr].size(); i++) {
                Edge edge = graph[curr].get(i);
                queue.add(edge.dest);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### üîÄ BFS on Disconnected Graph

```java
package graphTraversal.BFS;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class BFSOnGraphWithDisconnectedComponents {

    public static class Edge {
        int src;
        int dest;
        Edge(int src, int dest) {
            this.src = src;
            this.dest = dest;
        }
    }

    public static void createGraph(ArrayList<Edge>[] graph) {
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        graph[1].add(new Edge(1, 2));

        graph[2].add(new Edge(2, 1));
        graph[2].add(new Edge(2, 3));

        graph[3].add(new Edge(3, 2));

        graph[0].add(new Edge(0, 4));

        graph[4].add(new Edge(4, 0));
        graph[4].add(new Edge(4, 5));

        graph[5].add(new Edge(5, 4));
    }

    public static void bfs(ArrayList<Edge>[] graph, int v, boolean[] visited, int start) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(start);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = queue.remove();
            if (!visited[curr]) {
                System.out.print(curr + " ");
                visited[curr] = true;
                for (int i = 0; i < graph[curr].size(); i++) {
                    Edge edge = graph[curr].get(i);
                    queue.add(edge.dest);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int v = 6;
        ArrayList<Edge> graph[] = new ArrayList[v];
        createGraph(graph);

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[v];
        for (int i = 0; i < v; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                bfs(graph, v, visited, i);
            }
        }

        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

### üßÆ Time Complexity:
```
O(V + E)
V = Number of vertices  
E = Number of edges
```

## üîç Depth First Search (DFS)

DFS explores **as deep as possible** along each branch before backtracking ‚Äî similar to a pre-order traversal of a tree.

### DFS Algorithm (Recursive):

```java
    public static void dfs(ArrayList<Edge>[] graph, int curr, boolean[] visited) {
        System.out.print(curr + " ");
        visited[curr] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[curr].size(); i++) {
            Edge edge = graph[curr].get(i);
            if (!visited[edge.dest]) {
                dfs(graph, edge.dest, visited);
            }
        }
    }
```
